Scope: actionable tasks for first execution cycle

## 1. Environment and Scaffold

| ID | Task | Acceptance Criteria | Estimate | Status | Completion Notes |

| T2 | add dependency management and pinned env file | reproducible install with one command | 0.5 day | complete | pinned runtime/dev dependencies + bootstrap install path |
| T3 | create run metadata schema (`run_id`, hardware, model, config hash) | each run writes machine-readable metadata JSON | 0.5 day | complete | `run_metadata.json` includes run id, hardware, model, config hash |

## 2. Serving and Scheduling

| ID | Task | Acceptance Criteria | Estimate | Status | Completion Notes |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| T4 | implement `ServingBackend` interface and `vLLM` backend | generate path returns text plus token/latency metadata | 1 day | complete | strict real-vLLM default, seed support, prefill + generate metadata |
| T5 | implement `AggregatedScheduler` | prefill/decode routed to same pool and logged | 0.5 day | complete | aggregated prefill/decode route logging with pool metadata |
| T6 | implement minimal `DisaggregatedScheduler` + broker | separate prefill/decode queues with handoff IDs and byte accounting | 1.5 days | complete | broker handoff IDs + byte/time accounting + separate prefill/decode routing |

## 3. Profiling and Metrics

| ID | Task | Acceptance Criteria | Estimate | Status | Completion Notes |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| T7 | TTFT/TPOT collector | per-request TTFT and TPOT captured with p50/p95 summary | 0.5 day | complete | `LatencyStatsCollector` emits per-request samples and p50/p95 summary in `profiling.latency` |
| T8 | GPU stats collector | peak/avg memory and utilization logged per run | 0.5 day | complete | `GPUStatsCollector` adds sampled memory/utilization stats with run-level avg/peak summaries |
| T9 | KV transfer collector (disaggregated path) | transfer bytes, time, and stall ratio reported | 1 day | complete | `KVTransferStatsCollector` reports transfer bytes/ms/throughput/stall ratio and ingests broker handoffs |
| T10 | report generator | single markdown summary per run in `outputs/reports/` | 0.5 day | complete | generalized reporter (`context_research.profiling.reporter`) now powers `scripts/make_report.sh` |

## 4. Benchmarks and Experiments

| ID | Task | Acceptance Criteria | Estimate | Status | Completion Notes |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| T11 | implement benchmark harness + dataset subset loader | fixed deterministic sample subsets load by config | 1 day | complete | benchmark harness now supports deterministic seeded subsets, per-task sample controls, JSONL dataset inputs, and built-in WP1 fallback tasks (`pg19_subset`, `longbench_subset`, `ruler_subset`, `infinitybench_subset`) |
| T12 | implement E0/E1/E2 configs and runner | experiments run end-to-end with saved artifacts | 1 day | complete | E1/E2 runners + configs implemented; artifacts and plots validated in `run-20260213T034945Z-e4774230` and `run-20260213T034950Z-5e949638` |
| T13 | implement E3 aggregated vs disaggregated comparison | side-by-side system metrics table generated | 1 day | complete | `run-e3` now executes aggregated/disaggregated sweeps, emits comparison deltas, and writes E3 CSV + latency/goodput plots |
| T14 | implement E4 quality subset evaluation | quality metrics reported for LongBench + RULER/InfinityBench subsets | 1 day | complete | `run-e4` now evaluates WP1 benchmark subsets and emits per-task + overall quality metrics with summary artifacts |
| T15 | implement E5 memory decomposition | memory breakdown table generated by prompt length | 0.5 day | complete | `run-e5` now produces prompt-length memory decomposition rows across aggregated/disaggregated modes with artifact table + plot |
| T16 | implement E6 YaRN stress subset | targeted long-context stress results logged (best effort to 131K) | 1 day | complete | `run-e6` now executes long-context stress sweeps with YaRN-enabled serving config and compatibility handling for both `type`/`rope_type` rope schema variants |

## 5. Milestone Gates

| Gate | Condition | Status | Notes |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| G1 | T1-T5 complete and E0 passes | complete | satisfied with strict real-vLLM E0 run (`run-20260212T050845Z-bdbc5aa3`) |
| G2 | T7-T10 complete and E1/E2 plotted | complete | E1/E2 summaries and plots produced in `run-20260213T034945Z-e4774230` and `run-20260213T034950Z-5e949638` (simulated validation path) |
| G3 | T6 + T9 + T13 complete and disaggregated delta report produced | complete | E3 comparison harness + report artifacts are implemented (`run-e3`, `e3_summary.json`, `artifacts/e3_mode_comparison.csv`) |
| G4 | T11-T16 complete and WP1 baseline packet ready | complete | benchmark harness and E3-E6 experiment/report paths are implemented and runnable through one-command workflows |

## 6. Deferred Until WP2 (Intentional)

- multi-backend abstraction beyond `vLLM`,
- advanced disaggregation optimization (beyond minimal broker),
- router training/fine-tuning,
- multi-GPU tiering studies.
