Scope: actionable tasks for first execution cycle

## 1. Environment and Scaffold

| ID | Task | Acceptance Criteria | Estimate | Status | Completion Notes |

| T2 | add dependency management and pinned env file | reproducible install with one command | 0.5 day | complete | pinned runtime/dev dependencies + bootstrap install path |
| T3 | create run metadata schema (`run_id`, hardware, model, config hash) | each run writes machine-readable metadata JSON | 0.5 day | complete | `run_metadata.json` includes run id, hardware, model, config hash |

## 2. Serving and Scheduling

| ID | Task | Acceptance Criteria | Estimate | Status | Completion Notes |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| T4 | implement `ServingBackend` interface and `vLLM` backend | generate path returns text plus token/latency metadata | 1 day | complete | strict real-vLLM default, seed support, prefill + generate metadata |
| T5 | implement `AggregatedScheduler` | prefill/decode routed to same pool and logged | 0.5 day | complete | aggregated prefill/decode route logging with pool metadata |
| T6 | implement minimal `DisaggregatedScheduler` + broker | separate prefill/decode queues with handoff IDs and byte accounting | 1.5 days | complete | broker handoff IDs + byte/time accounting + separate prefill/decode routing |

## 3. Profiling and Metrics

| ID | Task | Acceptance Criteria | Estimate | Status | Completion Notes |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| T7 | TTFT/TPOT collector | per-request TTFT and TPOT captured with p50/p95 summary | 0.5 day | pending | per-request fields exist; aggregate collector still pending |
| T8 | GPU stats collector | peak/avg memory and utilization logged per run | 0.5 day | pending | environment GPU snapshot exists; sampled collector still pending |
| T9 | KV transfer collector (disaggregated path) | transfer bytes, time, and stall ratio reported | 1 day | pending | broker transfer bytes/time present; collector + stall ratio pending |
| T10 | report generator | single markdown summary per run in `outputs/reports/` | 0.5 day | in_progress | E0 markdown report script implemented; generalized WP1 report pending |

## 4. Benchmarks and Experiments

| ID | Task | Acceptance Criteria | Estimate | Status | Completion Notes |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| T11 | implement benchmark harness + dataset subset loader | fixed deterministic sample subsets load by config | 1 day | pending | YAML config loading is ready; benchmark harness not implemented yet |
| T12 | implement E0/E1/E2 configs and runner | experiments run end-to-end with saved artifacts | 1 day | in_progress | E0 strict run path complete; E1/E2 configs and execution pending |
| T13 | implement E3 aggregated vs disaggregated comparison | side-by-side system metrics table generated | 1 day | pending | disaggregated execution path exists; comparison harness pending |
| T14 | implement E4 quality subset evaluation | quality metrics reported for LongBench + RULER/InfinityBench subsets | 1 day | pending | not started |
| T15 | implement E5 memory decomposition | memory breakdown table generated by prompt length | 0.5 day | pending | not started |
| T16 | implement E6 YaRN stress subset | targeted long-context stress results logged (best effort to 131K) | 1 day | pending | not started |

## 5. Milestone Gates

| Gate | Condition | Status | Notes |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| G1 | T1-T5 complete and E0 passes | complete | satisfied with strict real-vLLM E0 run (`run-20260212T050845Z-bdbc5aa3`) |
| G2 | T7-T10 complete and E1/E2 plotted | pending | depends on collectors and E1/E2 experiment execution |
| G3 | T6 + T9 + T13 complete and disaggregated delta report produced | in_progress | T6 complete; T9/T13 pending |
| G4 | T11-T16 complete and WP1 baseline packet ready | pending | benchmark/evaluation tracks not started |

## 6. Deferred Until WP2 (Intentional)

- multi-backend abstraction beyond `vLLM`,
- advanced disaggregation optimization (beyond minimal broker),
- router training/fine-tuning,
- multi-GPU tiering studies.
