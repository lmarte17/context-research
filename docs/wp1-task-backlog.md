# WP1 Task Backlog (Locked Configuration)

Prepared: February 9, 2026  
Scope: actionable tasks for first execution cycle

## 1. Environment and Scaffold

| ID | Task | Acceptance Criteria | Estimate |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| T1 | initialize Python project scaffold (`src/`, `configs/`, `scripts/`, `outputs/`) | directories exist, import path works, basic CLI runs | 0.5 day |
| T2 | add dependency management and pinned env file | reproducible install with one command | 0.5 day |
| T3 | create run metadata schema (`run_id`, hardware, model, config hash) | each run writes machine-readable metadata JSON | 0.5 day |

## 2. Serving and Scheduling

| ID | Task | Acceptance Criteria | Estimate |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| T4 | implement `ServingBackend` interface and `vLLM` backend | generate path returns text plus token/latency metadata | 1 day |
| T5 | implement `AggregatedScheduler` | prefill/decode routed to same pool and logged | 0.5 day |
| T6 | implement minimal `DisaggregatedScheduler` + broker | separate prefill/decode queues with handoff IDs and byte accounting | 1.5 days |

## 3. Profiling and Metrics

| ID | Task | Acceptance Criteria | Estimate |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| T7 | TTFT/TPOT collector | per-request TTFT and TPOT captured with p50/p95 summary | 0.5 day |
| T8 | GPU stats collector | peak/avg memory and utilization logged per run | 0.5 day |
| T9 | KV transfer collector (disaggregated path) | transfer bytes, time, and stall ratio reported | 1 day |
| T10 | report generator | single markdown summary per run in `outputs/reports/` | 0.5 day |

## 4. Benchmarks and Experiments

| ID | Task | Acceptance Criteria | Estimate |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| T11 | implement benchmark harness + dataset subset loader | fixed deterministic sample subsets load by config | 1 day |
| T12 | implement E0/E1/E2 configs and runner | experiments run end-to-end with saved artifacts | 1 day |
| T13 | implement E3 aggregated vs disaggregated comparison | side-by-side system metrics table generated | 1 day |
| T14 | implement E4 quality subset evaluation | quality metrics reported for LongBench + RULER/InfinityBench subsets | 1 day |
| T15 | implement E5 memory decomposition | memory breakdown table generated by prompt length | 0.5 day |
| T16 | implement E6 YaRN stress subset | targeted long-context stress results logged (best effort to 131K) | 1 day |

## 5. Milestone Gates

| Gate | Condition |
| :---- | :---- |
| G1 | T1-T5 complete and E0 passes |
| G2 | T7-T10 complete and E1/E2 plotted |
| G3 | T6 + T9 + T13 complete and disaggregated delta report produced |
| G4 | T11-T16 complete and WP1 baseline packet ready |

## 6. Deferred Until WP2 (Intentional)

- multi-backend abstraction beyond `vLLM`,
- advanced disaggregation optimization (beyond minimal broker),
- router training/fine-tuning,
- multi-GPU tiering studies.
